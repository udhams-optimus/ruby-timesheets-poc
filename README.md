Overview

We will develop a web application using Ruby on Rails for employee time reports by fetching data from redmine and gate entry database. These reports will be for efficiency, billing and deployment of the staff member on different projects.


Application Goals

This is a POC project for Ruby on rails learning. This application will make it easier for Team Leads/ Project Managers to create the reports of the employees in their projects. This application will get the data from the Redmine and Gate entries which will reduce the manual work.


Functional Requirements

The web application will allow the Managers/ Team Leads to login and review the efficiency, billing and deployment details.
The web application will allow the Managers/ Team Leads to display the time entries of all the employees for a week, month or year after fetching from redmine.
This web application will allow the Managers/Team Leads to review the time entries of the employees and he/she will be able to update the entries into the internal and external categories.
This application will ask for redmine username and password while fetching data from Redmine.
The web application will allow the Managers/ Team Leads to input the resource allocation details and later can be used for generating the following charts:
Project Allocation chart
Resource Date chart
Resource Total chart
Owner wise chart
